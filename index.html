<H2>What is BuildAMation?</H2>
<p>BuildAMation (Bam) is a build system and project generator written in C#, targetting at least version 4.0 (requires support for LINQ and lambda expressions). It consists of a core assembly (Bam.Core.dll) that implements generic data structures and a dependency graph generation and evaluation algorithms. Specific implementation to compile and link code for programming languages, such as C and C++, specific toolchains, and other useful features, are provided in packages that extend the core infrastructure.</p>
<p>Bam can be used on Microsoft Windows (7+), Apple OSX (10.8+), and some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 14 and CentOS 7). OSX and Linux support for C# is provided through mono currently.</p>
<p>Bam packages contain C# code written in a declarative perspective. Therefore evaluation of the code is out of order from reading the scripts top-down. Packages can either provide new data structures/algorithms, or can use such definitions to describe how code can be built. Collections of packages can be grouped together logically into repositories. Each package requires a definition file (in XML) which defines all of it's dependencies.</p>
<p>Such algorithms provided by packages are build modes. By default, Bam provides four modes: Native, MakeFile, VSSolution, Xcode.</p>
<p>A command line tool, bam, is provided to execute packages. This also contains support to create a project for both VisualStudio or Xamarin Studio to debug package builds.</p>
