<p>From a binary distribution, open a terminal to the extracted files, and on Linux or macOS (or Windows msys), run
<pre><code class="bash">source env.sh</code></pre>
or on a Windows cmd prompt, run
<pre><code class="bash">env.bat</code></pre>
Alternatively, if you have access to PowerShell on Windows, you can run the create_shortcut_to_env.ps1 script in the BAM root directory to create a shortcut to persist a cmd prompt for BAM.</p>
<p>This will install Bam onto your PATH, and will show the details of the version of Bam on the console (including references to git branches/tags), for example:</p>

<p>From source, you can compile Bam using the provided solution file, and run the tool through the IDE. This is useful if the core assembly needs to be updated. However, the general approach to using Bam is identical to that in the binary distribution. Note if you have compiled a debug version of the Core, then pass 'Debug' as an argument to the shell scripts mentioned above - the default is to use a 'Release' configuration.</p>
