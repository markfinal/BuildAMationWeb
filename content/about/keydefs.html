<H2>Package</H2>
<p>A package is a folder on disk, identified by a 'bam' subdirectory, an <code>.xml</code> file under 'bam', and containing one or more <code>.cs</code> files in a Scripts subfolder. A package can be thought of to define classes and functions which implement modules.</p>
<H2>Package repository</H2>
<p>Bam defines a collection of packages to be a package repository. There is a default package repository provided with the Bam binary distribution, and also in the source on github. Any number of repositories can be downloaded and used together to collate the set of packages required to build your software. A package repository consists of a <b>packages</b> folder, and optionally a <b>tests</b> folder, each containing Bam packages.</p>
<H2>Package definition file</H2>
<p>A package definition file is an XML file, implementing the schema provided with Bam, defining
<ul>
<li>the package's name (and optionally version),</li>
<li>the dependent packages required in a build,</li>
<li>package repositories to search,</li>
<li>Bam assemblies to reference (including a minimum version),</<strong></strong></li>
<li>any additional .NET packages,</li>
<li>any required <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a> packages (on a per-platform basis) [new in v2.0],</li>
<li>any required archive URLs (.zip, .tar, .tgz) to download and extract for package source [new in v2.0],</li>
<li>and package specific compilation options.</li>
</ul>
The first package definition file read is from the <b>master package</b>, and is allowed to define 'default' packages which can be used to resolve packages that have multiple versions specified (usually toolchain packages).</p>
<p>For example, suppose VisualC packages with versions 14.0 and 15.0 have been specified in package definition files. Without any <em>default</em> specification, Bam will issue an error that it cannot solve the package version ambiguity. With a <em>default</em> specification on the version of the VisualC package you wish to use in the master package, no error will be issued. If you want to override the default specification on the command line, pass <code>--VisualC.version=15.0</code>, say, to use version 15.0. This works for all packages, with a command line syntax of <code>--packagename.version=someversion</code>.
<H2>Module</H2>
<p>Modules are the first class citizens of what Bam uses to build software. They are classes (sealed to be buildable, abstract/unsealed to define functionality) defined in package scripts, but there is no explicit instantiation of these classes in those scripts. The Bam core assembly deals with instantiating and ordering modules. Modules have methods that evaluate whether the code they reference is out of date. Modules also define policies, dependent on the build mode, of how to execute when they do require building.</p>
<p>The C# scripts define classes within a namespace, and the namespace is the package name. Bam uses this convention to search for modules within a specific package.</p>
<p>Almost everything is a module in the Bam package universe. So almost everything is buildable.</p>
<p>Dependencies are stated at the module level in package scripts. The basic module class is only aware of two axiomatic principles:
<ol>
<li>I depend on a module to be built before me, or</li>
<li>I require this module to be present and up-to-date, but do not need it to build.</li>
</ol>
Packages add semantic meaning atop of the axioms by way of providing specific methods on their modules, e.g. a C program must compile and link against a C static library, is coded in terms of the axioms, and is called <code>CompileAndLinkAgainst</code>.</p>
<H2>Tool</H2>
<p>Tools are a type of module, but are referenced when executing build mode policies of other modules. This means that tools can be procedurally generated as part of a build. Equally, prebuilt tools, such as C/C++ compilers, appear in the same guise - Bam just requires them to exist on disk already.</p>
<H2>Build configurations</H2>
<p>There are three build configurations in the Bam core assembly:
<ol>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Optimized</li>
<li>Profile</li>
</ol>
The meaning of each configuration depends on how packages define their default settings, but which can equally be overridden by the user. Out of the box, C code builds will be debug symbols and no optimizations for debug; no debug symbols and full optimizations for optimized; and debug symbols and full optimizations for profile. Bam builds can operate in one or more of these configurations. Thus, if the package scripts build a C executable, and Bam is executed in two configurations, there will be two different versions of that executable at the end of a successful Native build. Equally, if one of the project generation build modes is chosen, a project will be generated with two configurations.</p>
<p>To build in just debug, specify <code>--config=debug</code> on the command line, or specify no configuration options.<p>
<p>To build in both debug and profile, specify <code>--config=debug --config=profile</code> on the command line. In a project generation build mode, projects with multiple configurations will be generated where possible.</p>
<H2>Settings</H2>
<p>Settings are classes closely associated with tools, which implement one or more <b>settings interface</b>, which just declare properties. Each tool is associated with a Settings class. Each Settings class concatenates interfaces (through inheritence) to create a unique collection of properties. Each module has an instance of the settings for its tool, so that the execution of the tool can be tailored for that module.</p>
<p>Settings have defaults, but each module can override any default by applying a <b>patch</b>. Additionally, the defaults can be modified prior to patching via a <b>site policy</b>, e.g. say your software must build against the C++11 standard, while the default Bam compilation mode is C++98, the site policy allows this to be changed for your software in one place.</p>
<p>A patch is implemented in terms of a lambda function. Bam defines two types of patches, public and private. Private, as the name suggests, is applied just to the build of the module. Public patches get applied both to the build of the module, and any module that has defined a dependency on it.</p>
<H2>Build mode</H2>
<p>The Bam build mode is the name of the policy to execute packages against. The core infrastructure does not have any dependency on specific build modes. Instead, implementations are discovered dynamically through reflection in the packages that are included in a build. Those build modes available are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native - a command line build, that can use all available cores, and has implicit dependency checking for C compilation (i.e. can detect changes in #include'd headers)</li>
<li>MakeFile - generate a GNU or NMAKE MakeFile for the build</li>
<li>VSSolution - generate VisualStudio projects and a solution for the build</li>
<li>Xcode - generate Xcode projects and a workspace for the build</li>
</ul>
<H2>Macros</H2>
<p>Modules have a dictionary of named macros. The key to the dictionary is a string. The value associated with each key is a TokenizedString, described below.</p>
<H2>Tokenized String</H2>
<p>Bam defines strings with markup as TokenizedStrings. These use special syntax to identify tokens in the strings, so that parameterization is possible. The tokens are evaluated from macros from multiple sources:
<ul>
<li>the main dependency graph (for global macros),</li>
<li>the module the string is associated with,</li>
<li>a list of other TokenizedStrings,</li>
<li>the local environment variables, and</li>
<li>custom macros.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>A simple example of a TokenizedString is
<pre>
$(buildroot)
</pre>
which will look for the macro named <em>buildroot</em> in its sources, and if found, replaces the token with its value.</p>
<p>Simple TokenizedStrings, with no markup, just literal text, are known as verbatim. Some TokenizedStrings can be inlined into others (useful for modules and tools that refer to each others macros).</p>
<p>After macro replacement is complete, simple functions can be applied, e.g. get the basename of a file. This allows for a more powerful construction syntax. For example:
<pre>
@basename(~/mark/dev/foobar.txt)
</pre>
will return <code>foobar</code>, while
<pre>
@dir(~/mark/dev/foobar.txt)
</pre>
will return <code>~/mark/dev</code>.
</p>
<p>There is also support for functions to run prior to macro replacement. For example:
<pre>
$(MajorVersion).$(MinorVersion)#valid(.$(PatchVersion))
</pre>
runs the <code>valid</code> function to determine if its expression is a valid TokenizedString; if not, the whole function call is removed; if it is, only the expression remains.</p>
<p>All TokenizedStrings are parsed just prior to the dependency graph execution. This allows dynamic strings to be constructed, but altered as package scripts are executed. The parameterized source is terse, and references to macros offer an additional level of semantics.</p>
<p>Note that any TokenizedStrings created during dependency graph execution, will need to be manually parsed, using the <code>Parse()</code> method.</p>
<H2>Module configuration</H2>
<p>Modules can declare an interface that exposes configuration options for how to build that module, so that the caller module/package can specify how its requirements.</p>
<p>Several interfaces are required to be implemented:</p>
<H3>Bam.Core.IHasModuleConfiguration</H3>
<p>Modules that expose a configuration interface must implement this interface.</p>
<H3>Bam.Core.IModuleConfiguration</H3>
<p>The interface that a module declares as it's configuration must inherit this interface. The interface must only declare read-only properties. This is to be used in patches within the module. In additional to an interface, a class implementing this interface must also be provided, with the configuration defaults in its constructor, and public setters on the interface properties.</p>
<H3>Bam.Core.IOverrideModuleConfiguration</H3>
<p>This is intended for the top-level user. A non-abstract class must implement this interface, in order to get access to the class allowing modification to a Module's configuration.</p>
