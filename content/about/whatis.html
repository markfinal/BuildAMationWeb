</ul>
<p>BuildAMation (Bam) is a <em>build system</em> and <em>project generator</em> written in C#, requiring at least <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">.NET Core</a> 2.1. (Version 1.x of Bam was written against .NET Framework 4.) Some familiarity with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/a72418yk.aspx">C# language</a> is assumed in this documentation and for using Bam. The latest minor version of the latest major version of the C# language is used (C# 7.3 at the time of writing).</p>
<p>Bam can be used on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and some Linux distributions (.NET Core is not available on all distros).</p>
<p>Bam consists of a core assembly (Bam.Core.dll) that implements data agnostic algorithms for dependency evaluation. The specifics of compiling and linking code for programming languages, such as C and C++, toolchains (VisualC, Clang, Gcc, etc) are provided in packages that build upon the core infrastructure using a domain specific syntax that is declarative in nature.</p>
<p>Bam packages contain declarative propositions called <b>modules</b>, in the form of C# classes. Evaluation of the modules is out of order, following dependencies set up between them; thus package scripts are not imperatively evaluated. Packages can either provide new abstract data structures and algorithms to extend Bam into new areas, or can implement concrete modules that, when evaluated, actually build code. Every package requires a <b>definition file</b> (in XML) which defines all of its dependencies. Collections of packages can be grouped together logically into <b>repositories</b>.</p>
<p>Examples of the modules provided by packages are <code>C.DynamicLibrary</code> and <code>C.StaticLibrary</code>, which are the base classes used to build a dynamic or static library in the C programming language. The namespace of the classes defines the package in which they belong.</p>
<p>Examples of algorithms provided by packages are the build modes. The default package repository in Bam provides four modes: Native (command line), MakeFile, VSSolution, and Xcode, the latter three of which generate project files to be executed externally.</p>
<p>Bam benefits from the strongly typed nature of C#. In a declarative scripting language, where concrete instances of modules do not exist in user space, a dependency on a module is made on the <em>type</em> of the module, as a generic type parameter. Many utility functions exist that accept a module type as a generic argument. Interfaces are used to abstract away build settings that would otherwise require the user to be fluent in how to invoke many different tools to achieve the same desired effect. For example, many compiler flags are abstracted in an aptly named C# property in an interface, and each compiler implementation (in different packages) understands how to translate the value of that property, either as a command line switch, or as some field in a project script.</p>
<p>A command line tool, bam.dll (to be executed through the dotnet host application), is provided to execute packages. Shell scripts are provided to execute this on all platforms. To build a package, run bam in that package's directory. That package is known as the <em>master package</em>. bam also contains support to create a C# project for both VisualStudio, VisualStudio for Mac, or MonoDevelop, to edit scripts or debug package builds.</p>
<H2>What BuildAMation <em>is not</em></H2>
<p>Bam can perform many tasks to build code, but does not do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does <b>not</b> provide any <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html">autoconf</a> mechanism out of the box, to build different variants based on what files are on the development box, but modules can be written to achieve something similar. In particular, starting with v1.1.0, modules can expose a configuration interface that the user can set to their preferences.</li>
  <li>Will <b>not</b> detect changes to build settings between runs (c.f. default SCons behaviour). To cause a rebuild of already built code with new settings, you will need to change source code, or delete/clean already built files.</li>
  <li>Does <b>not</b> provide named settings for <em>all</em> compiler, linker and librarian options available. However, most Settings classes do implement the <code>C.IAdditionalSettings</code> interface, which allows arbitrary switches to be passed to tools.</li>
  <li>Does <b>not</b> provide packages for all versions of all toolchains. I've chosen what I think is a reasonable set of C and C++ compilers on each platform to test against to build modern software. If you want to use a different toolchain, a package can be made for it.</li>
</ul>
