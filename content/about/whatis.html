</ul>
<p>BuildAMation (Bam) is a <em>build system</em> and <em>project generator</em> written in C#, requiring at least .NET framework 4.0 (requires support for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397926.aspx">LINQ</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/bb397687.aspx">lambda expressions</a>). Some familiarity with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/a72418yk.aspx">C# language</a> is assumed in this documentation and for using Bam.</p>
<p>Bam can be used on Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, and some Linux distributions. OSX and Linux support for C# is provided through <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> currently.</p>
<p>Bam consists of a core assembly (Bam.Core.dll) that implements data agnostic algorithms for dependency evaluation. The specifics of compiling and linking code for programming languages, such as C and C++, toolchains (VisualC, Clang, Gcc, etc) are provided in packages that build upon the core infrastructure using a domain specific syntax that is declarative in nature.</p>
<p>Bam packages contain declarative propositions called <b>modules</b>, in the form of C# classes. Evaluation of the modules is out of order, following dependencies set up between them; thus package scripts are not imperatively evaluated. Packages can either provide new abstract data structures and algorithms to extend Bam into new areas, or can implement concrete modules that, when evaluated, actually build code. Every package requires a <b>definition file</b> (in XML) which defines all of its dependencies. Collections of packages can be grouped together logically into <b>repositories</b>.</p>
<p>Examples of the data structures provided by packages are <code>C.DynamicLibrary</code> and <code>C.StaticLibrary</code>, which are the base classes used to build a dynamic or static library in the C programming language. The namespace of the classes defines the package in which they belong.</p>
<p>Examples of algorithms provided by packages are the build modes. The default package repository in Bam provides four modes: Native (command line), MakeFile, VSSolution, and Xcode.</p>
<p>Bam benefits from the strongly typed nature of C#. In a declarative scripting language, where concrete instances of modules do not exist in user space, a dependency on a module is made by the type of the module, as a generic type parameter. Many utility functions exist that accept a module type as a generic argument. Interfaces are used to abstract away build settings that would otherwise require the user to be fluent in how to invoke many different tools to achieve the same desired effect. For example, each compiler flag is abstracted in a suitably named C# property in an interface, and each compiler implementation (in different packages) understands how to translate the value of that property, either as a command line switch, or as some field in a project script.</p>
<p>A command line tool, bam.exe, is provided to execute packages (a shell script is provided to wrap this on OSX and Linux). To build a package, run bam in that package's directory. That package is known as the <em>master package</em>. bam also contains support to create a project for both VisualStudio or Xamarin Studio to edit scripts or debug package builds.</p>
<H2>What BuildAMation <em>is not</em></H2>
<p>Bam can perform many tasks to build code, but does not do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does <b>not</b> provide any <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html">autoconf</a> mechanism out of the box, to build different variants based on what files are on the development box, but modules can be written to achieve something similar.</li>
  <li>Will <b>not</b> detect changes to build settings between runs (c.f. default SCons behaviour). To rebuild with new settings, you will need to change source code, or delete/clean already built files.</li>
  <li>Does <b>not</b> provide named settings for <em>all</em> compiler, linker and librarian options available. However, most Settings classes do implement the <code>C.IAdditionalSettings</code> interface, which allows arbitrary switches to be passed to tools.</li>
  <li>Does <b>not</b> provide packages for all versions of all toolchains. I've chosen what I think is a reasonable set of C and C++ compilers on each platform to test against to build modern software. If you want to use a different toolchain, a package can be made for it.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Competition</H2>
<p>The competitors to Bam that I know of are:</p>
