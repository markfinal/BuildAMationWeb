<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>Windows 7 and 8 are compatible, in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavours.</p>
<p>In support of free developer tools, VisualStudio Express support is included out of the box, from 2008 through to 2013. Paid-for editions of VisualStudio may work but not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Recent versions of Mingw are also included out of the box.
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 12-14 are compatible, in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavours.</p>
<p>It is recommended a recent version of GCC is used, such as 4.8.</p>
<p>Most Linux distros do not come with a modern Mono build. Compiling it yourself is not difficult.</p>
<h2>OSX</h2>
<p>OSX 10.8-10.10 are compatible, in 64-bit Intel flavours.</p>
<p>Mono can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">the Mono project</a></p>
