<p>Let's consider an example package called TestPackage. Suppose we have a directory <code>TestPackage</code> containing a single source file <code>main.c</code> to build. We will assume that <code>main.c</code> contains some sensible C code to make an executable program, e.g. at least a main function. Note that for the benefit of this demonstration, it's important to be C code, not C++; for example:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("Hello world\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<H2>Make a package</H2>
<p>Making a package is the first step to using Bam. Change into the TestPackage directory, and type
<pre><code class="bash">bam --makepackage --pkgname=TestPackage
</code></pre>
This will create the bam folder, the package definition file, and a script file containing an empty TestPackage namespace.</p>
<H2>Add dependencies</H2>
<p>As we intend to build some C code, so we need to pull in package dependencies that provide this support. Still in the TestPackage directory, type
<pre><code class="bash">bam --adddependent --pkgname=C
bam --adddependent --pkgname=NativeBuilder
bam --adddependent --pkgname=VSSolutionBuilder
bam --adddependent --pkgname=MakeFileBuilder
bam --adddependent --pkgname=XcodeBuilder
bam --adddependent --pkgname=VisualC --pkgversion=15.0
bam --adddependent --pkgname=Gcc --pkgversion=4.8
bam --adddependent --pkgname=Clang --pkgversion=Xcode9
</code></pre>
These commands have modified the package definition file, and add support not only to build C code, but also build in all default build modes, and all supported platforms. To view the changes that have been made to the package definition file, run this command
<pre><code class="bash">bam --showdefinition
</code></pre>
Here is what you should see from running this command:

<p>You will have noticed that there are packages listed in the output that you didn't specify on the command line. This is because package definitions are evaluated recursively, such that depending on package A will bring in all of A's dependents. For example, the VisualC-15.0 package is dependent upon both VisualCCommon and the WindowsSDK-10, neither of which needed to be specified on the command line while setting up the test package.</p>
<H2>Create a project for your package</H2>
<p>Now that all the dependencies are configured, you can create a project to edit and run from your preferred IDE. Still in the TestPackage directory, type
<pre><code class="bash">bam -p
</code></pre>
The output will be similar to
<pre>
Querying package repositories...
Successfully created debug project for package 'TestPackage'
        C:\Users\mark\AppData\Local\Temp\TestPackage\PackageDebug\TestPackage-bam.csproj
</pre>
The generated project can be opened in VisualStudio on Windows, VisualStudio for Mac on macos, or MonoDevelop on Linux.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open VisualStudio, press Ctrl+Shift+O, and paste the path to the .csproj in the Open Project dialog.</li>
<li>On macOS, on a terminal, type <code>open -a 'visual studio' <.csproj path></code> to open the project in VisualStudio for Mac. (The quotes are important.)</li>
<li>On Linux Gnome window manager, on a terminal, type <code>gnome-open <.csproj path></code> to open the project in MonoDevelop.</li>
</ul>
<p>(You may want to set up aliases in your shells for these.)</p>
<p>Once opened, you can browse through the source for the dependent package. Debugging this project will also invoke Bam - the entry point is in the main.cs file in the project, and automatically generated by the earlier command. The code in this file can be modified but be aware that if the project generation command is executed again, this file is overwritten.</p>
<p>To continue this example, open the TestPackage.cs file from within the TestPackage package in the IDE.</p>
<H2>A simple program</H2>
<p>In the script file, define a module called MyProgram, which is a C (not C++) console application, compiling main.c in the package directory. We will revisit a C++ source file later.</p>
<pre><code>namespace TestPackage
{
  sealed class MyProgram :
    C.ConsoleApplication
  {
     protected override void
     Init(
       Bam.Core.Module parent)
     {
        base.Init(parent);
        this.CreateCSourceContainer("$(packagedir)/main.c");
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<H4>Explanation</H4>
<ul>
<li>The namespace of the module is the name of the package it resides in, <code>TestPackage</code>.</li>
<li>The name of the module is <code>MyProgram</code>, which is the name of the class. The executable generated will use the module name. This can be overridden.</li>
<li>The class is <code>sealed</code>, which is an indication to Bam that all dependencies of this module will need to be evaluated.</li>
<li>MyProgram derives from <code>C.ConsoleApplication</code>. This is a class from the C package (using the convention of package name as namespace), which defines the necessary infrastructure for compiling and linking a C console application.</li>
<li>The <code>Init</code> function is overridden from the base class. Init is used to define the properties of the module. This is used instead of the module constructor, as there are restrictions before an object is constructed in C#.</li>
<li>The Init function of the parent class is called first. Chaining the hierarchy in this way ensures that modules are configured consistently.</li>
<li>A method of the base class, <code>CreateCSourceContainer</code>, is invoked, passing a string which is internally converted to a <em>TokenizedString</em>. This function's implementation expands the parameterized string into file paths, and creates additional <em>source file</em> modules for each, and configures dependencies. Wildcards can be used in the path to evaluate to more than one file. In this case, there is only one, the file main.c in the package directory.</li>
</ul>
Now try to build the package
<pre><code class="bash">bam -b=Native
</code></pre>
The result will be an executable in a subdirectory of the <em>build</em> directory of the package. The root directory where files are built is configurable with the <code>-o</code> command line argument.</p>
<H2>Private patch</H2>
<p>Private patches are applied solely to the build of the module they are applied to. In this example, a C preprocessor definition is added to the compilation of the source file.</p>
<pre><code>namespace TestPackage
{
  sealed class MyProgram :
    C.ConsoleApplication
  {
     protected override void
     Init(
       Bam.Core.Module parent)
     {
        base.Init(parent);
        <mark>var sources =</mark> this.CreateCSourceContainer("$(packagedir)/main.c");
        <mark>sources.PrivatePatch(settings =>
          {
             var compiler = settings as C.ICommonCompilerSettings;
             compiler.PreprocessorDefines.Add("CUSTOM_DEFINE");
          });</mark>
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<H4>Explanation</H4>
<ul>
<li>The return value of CreateCSourceContainer is now stored in a local variable. This is a list of all modules representing the compilation of source files, i.e. object files. In this example, there is just one object file. Adding patches on the container affects <em>all</em> of the source files it contains.</li>
<li>A private patch accepts a lambda expression with a single argument, which is the settings object for the module on which it's applied.</li>
<li>Settings can then be cast into the interfaces which make up the module's settings class (i.e. those settings associated with the Tool used to build the module). For a private patch, as you know the module type it is applied to, you can almost always guarantee which interfaces can be used. The exception to this general rule occurs when a tool/OS specific interface is not applicable to all cases, e.g. Gcc specific settings but you are building on Windows, so you may have check whether the interface is valid. This is easily achieved by comparing the result of the cast against <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>C.ICommonCompilerSettings</code> interface defines a property, <code>PreprocessorDefines</code>, allowing the module writer to manage preprocessor definitions in the build.</li>
</ul>
Now try to build the package
<pre><code class="bash">bam -b=Native
</code></pre>
At this point, no modules will be rebuilt. Bam does not inspect for changed build settings between invocations, so a clean build is required to take on the updated settings. This is somewhat over-the-top in many cases, as simply deleting the object file would suffice.
<pre><code class="bash">bam -b=Native -c
</code></pre>
If you inspect the command line output, you will see that CUSTOM_DEFINE is now passed as a preprocessor definition.</p>
<H2>Public patch</H2>
<p>Public patches are applied both to the build of the module they are applied to, and any packages that depend on it. A common case for this kind of patch is for a C library (static or dynamic) that has headers, and must expose an include search path to any other module that uses the library.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a static library, assuming library.c is present in the package directory and contains suitable code, and library.h is in an include folder in the package directory, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>#ifndef LIBRARY_H
#define LIBRARY_H

extern void printme(const char *string);

#endif /* LIBRARY_H */
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void printme(const char *string)
{
    printf("%s", string);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the modified package script to include the build of the library. The program does not yet depend on it.</p>
<pre><code>namespace TestPackage
{
  sealed class MyProgram :
    C.ConsoleApplication
  {
     ...
  }

  <mark>sealed class MyStaticLibrary :
      C.StaticLibrary
    {
        protected override void
        Init(
            Bam.Core.Module parent)
        {
            base.Init(parent);
            this.CreateCSourceContainer("$(packagedir)/library.c");
            this.PublicPatch((settings, appliedTo) =>
                {
                    var compiler = settings as C.ICommonCompilerSettings;
                    if (null != compiler)
                    {
                        compiler.IncludePaths.AddUnique(this.CreateTokenizedString("$(packagedir)/include"));
                    }
                });
        }
    }</mark>
}
</code></pre>
<H4>Explanation</H4>
<ul>
<li>The name of the new module is <code>MyStaticLibrary</code>. Similarly to the program above, the name of the library generated will use the module name.</li>
<li>The base class of this new module is <code>C.StaticLibrary</code> to indicate that the module will be a static library.</li>
<li><code>PublicPatch</code> is the function called. But note that the function is now applied on <code>this</code> (the module to be built), rather then sources. The reason for this is that any dependency is written in terms of the module MyStaticLibrary, rather than on any source contained within it. Although the <em>public</em> patch is applied to <code>this</code>, because the C source container is <em>encapsulated</em> within MyStaticLibrary, the patch is applied to the source automatically.</li>
<li>Note also that PublicPatch lambdas take two arguments; <code>settings</code> as before, and now also <code>appliedTo</code>. The latter is the module on which the patch is being applied to. For some public patches, it may be useful to know the module on which the patch is being applied. However, as in the example, <code>this</code> is usually the more useful module reference, to get the package directory of the source package, as opposed to using <code>appliedTo</code> which would get a different package directory.</li>
<li>Note the conditional on the cast of the settings. Public patches are applied to all modules using this module as a dependent, and to a module's hierarchy of <em>child modules</em>, so can be applied equally to a link or compilation step. The cast is necessary to avoid runtime null reference exceptions.</li>
<li>The use of the <em>Module</em> utility member function <code>CreateTokenizedString</code>, creates a <em>TokenizedString</em> that is tied to that module's macros for expansion. In this case, the TokenizedString function <code>$(packagedir)</code> will evaluate to the package directory of the module MyStaticLibrary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building the package now, requires no clean step, as a new module has been introduced. The output is the compilation and subsequent archiving of library.c into the static library. The program will not have changed.</p>
<H2>Adding a dependency</H2>
<p>Now change the program, so that it makes use of the library, e.g. change main.c to </p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
<mark>#include "library.h"</mark>

int main()
{
    <mark>printme("Hello world\n");</mark>
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Building the package now will result in a compilation failure. This is because Bam detects that the timestamp on the source file is now newer than it's corresponding object file and rebuilds it. The failure will be similar to this:</p>
<pre>
C:\Users\mark\AppData\Local\Temp\TestPackage\main.c(2): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'library.h': No such file or directory

ERROR: (Bam.Core.Exception) Error during non-threaded build

Command exit code: 2
</pre>
<p>These changes require the program to depend on the static library for both compilation (#include'ing the header) and for link (linking the function code). The <code>C.ConsoleApplication</code> module has a useful function to indicate how to do this.</p>
<pre><code>namespace TestPackage
{
    sealed class MyProgram :
      C.ConsoleApplication
    {
        protected override void
        Init(
            Bam.Core.Module parent)
        {
            base.Init(parent);
            var sources = this.CreateCSourceContainer("$(packagedir)/main.c");
            sources.PrivatePatch(settings =>
            {
                var compiler = settings as C.ICommonCompilerSettings;
                compiler.PreprocessorDefines.Add("CUSTOM_DEFINE");
            });

            <mark>this.CompileAndLinkAgainst&lt;MyStaticLibrary&gt;(sources);</mark>
        }
    }

    class MyStaticLibrary :
      C.StaticLibrary
    {
      ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<H4>Explanation</H4>
<ul>
<li><code>CompileAndLinkAgainst</code> is a generic function, that takes the dependent module type as the type argument, which Bam Core uses to set up module dependencies.</li>
<li>As CompileAndLinkAgainst is called on <code>this</code>, and <code>this</code> is a program, a link dependency is set up. Bam Core is not aware of the mean of a link dependency, but it does know that the program depends on the static library to be up to date before the program can be up to date. However the C package does know that a link dependency means the static library needs to be passed as an argument to the linker for the program, once it is up-to-date.</li>
<li>Also, CompileAndLinkAgainst takes (one or more) arguments, which are the modules which compile (i.e. object files) that have a requirement on the dependent module, as the function name suggests. A module dependency in the Bam sense is not actually required for compilation. However, any public patches from the dependent must be applied in order to use the public patch from the static library containing the include search path.</li>
<li>There are similar functions exposed on the C module base classes, such as <code>LinkAgainst</code> seen earlier, or compilation only (for header only libraries).</li>
<li>Do note that this is an example of Bam building out of order. MyStaticLibrary is listed <em>after</em> MyProgram in the package source, and yet, MyStaticLibrary needs to be up-to-date first, for MyProgram to link. Note that MyStaticLibrary is no longer sealed too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Build the package once again, and you should see in the compiler console output that include paths are now included on both the program source and the library source, and the program links and will run.</p>
<p>Run a clean build to satisfy yourself that the static library is compiled and archived first.</p>
<H2>Trying other build modes</H2>
<p>In the examples above, we have used the Native build mode to run command line builds of the package. Bam supports other types of build modes, some of which are specific to certain platforms. All the generated files are put into the build root, but each build mode will write to the console where the files can be found.</p>
<H4>Windows</H4>
<p>Generate a VisualStudio solution by running</p>
<pre><code class="bash">bam -b=VSSolution
</code></pre>
<H4>Linux (and macOS)</H4>
<p>Generate a MakeFile by running</p>
<pre><code class="bash">bam -b=MakeFile
</code></pre>
<p>The Makefile generated uses GNU make syntax, and not NMake that VisualStudio supports.</p>
<H4>macOS</H4>
<p>Generate an Xcode workspace by running</p>
<pre><code class="bash">bam -b=Xcode
</code></pre>
<H2>C++ code</H2>
<p>The examples above all build C code. However, the C package understands more derivatives of the C language than just this. It understands C++, ObjectiveC and ObjectiveC++. Bam uses the type of the module to determine which language it is using, and thus apply different tools and settings. For example, as shown above, a C program uses the base type
<pre><code>C.ConsoleApplication
</code></pre>
For a program that links C++ code, and thus requires the C++ linker, this would be
<pre><code>C.Cxx.ConsoleApplication
</code></pre>
Similarly, for source code, instead of
<pre><code>this.CreateCSourceContainer(paths)
</code></pre>
use
<pre><code>this.CreateCxxSourceContainer(paths)
</code></pre>
in order to use the C++ compiler for the toolchain.</p>
<p>It is also possible, and sometimes required, to create multiple source containers, from different languages. There is no restriction on how many times you call one of the create container functions. Ensure that you always link with the correct module type in order to use the right linker for your code.</p>
